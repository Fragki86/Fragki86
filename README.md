Hi👋 I’m Giorgos, a newly graduate Frontend developer living and working in Norway. 

I love researching new technologies and use them to design and develop IT solutions for businesses and not only. 

📖 Currently learning Svelte and Sql.

Outside the tech world, I enjoy getting involved with the investment world by researching and analyzing companies to invest in. 

I love traveling and spend a lots of quality time with my family.
